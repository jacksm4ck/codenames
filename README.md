# codenames
A project whose goal is to create an AI capable of playing the game Codenames

I don't know how far I'll take this but the eventual goal would be to create a robot that can physically play the game.

Doing so would mean accomplishing these primary tasks:
Reading the current game state (grid setup, covered words) - computer vision
Interpreting the current game state and either guessing or generating a clue - word association (eventually also taking into account the state of the game in order to play in an optimal manner)
Conveying decision to other participants (ie, outputting clue or selecting word to guess)
